Several days ago, while GyeHyun was mixing chemicals for 
AP Chemistry, an unfortunate explosion occurred. Nuclear 
radiation and other unknown chemicals swirled around and 
through the school, killing, mutilating, or otherwise 
transforming the people inside. 

Strangely, most of the students succumbed and their bodies 
vanished instantaneously, while many teachers were merely 
uglified and transformed into lethal mutants wandering the 
halls. Their brains have been warped and all they do is 
hunt down the remaining students and prevent anyone from 
going in or out of the school. You seem to be the only 
sane person left ... you simply have to escape! But some 
of the doors seem to be locked or guarded by these terrible 
teachers.

You awake in a room unfamiliar to you.. How long have you 
been asleep? It feels as though the walls have already 
begun to decay and bugs seem to rule dominant on all sides
of the room.. You grope around with your still-adjusting 
vision and manage to grab hold of a flashlight, putting it
in your bag for safekeeping. You must find a way out, or
you will die in this strange place that used to be your
humble school...
